# __QB-Viz: The Instructions__    :shipit::shipit::shipit:

### Activate the Virtual Environment
Navigate to the QB-Viz directory in the command line
run `C:\...\QB-Viz> qbvenv\Scripts\Activate `

### Set Environment Variables
With the Virtual Environment Active:
- run:

>`(qbvenv) C:\...\QB-Viz> cd app`
>
>`(qbvenv) C:\...\QB-Viz\app> set FLASK_APP=qbviz.py`
>
>`(qbvenv) C:\...\QB-Viz\app> flask run `

### A local server should start at http://localhost:500 which will render the app


### TODO:
- Had to go for the canned embed code... something weird going on with the js api... will look into it
- Need to fix the EV calculations in the workbook to match Greg's math

- Nav bar and annotations are wrong/contain dead links (left from original concept)

# QB-Viz: The Instructions

### Activate the Virtual Environment
Navigate to the QB-Viz directory in the command line
run `qbvenv\Scripts\Activate`

### Set Environment Variables
With the Virtual Environment Active:
- run `set FLASK_APP=qbviz.py`
- run `flask run`

### A local server should start at http://localhost:500 which will render the app


### TODO:
- Had to go for the canned embed code... something weird going on with the js api... will look into it
- Need to fix the EV calculations in the workbook to match Greg's math

- Nav bar and annotations are wrong/contain dead links (left from original concept)
